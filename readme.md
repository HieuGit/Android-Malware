1. Navigate to files folder and place malware and benign apps into their respective folder
2. Run 'python add_db.py' to save all the features extracted from all apks
3. Once all the features are saved into the database, Run 'python model_train.py' to create a training model for classification
4. Finally run 'python predict.py <apk-name>' to perform the classification of that given apk.
5. Happy Coding
