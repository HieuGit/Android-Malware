# Project Title
Android Malware Detection using Support Vector Machine Classifier

### Prerequisites
* [androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) - Reverse Engineering tool for android applications
* [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) - Machine Learning library for python
* [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=homepage#community) - A No-SQL database
* [pymongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver) - Python driver for MongoDB


## Instructions
1. Navigate to 'files' folder and place malware and benign apps into their respective folder.
2. Run 'python add_db.py' to save all the features extracted from all apks.
3. Run 'create_data.py' to get data from mongodb and save it to a csv file.
4. Once the 'data.csv' file is created, Run 'python feature_selection.py <path to data.csv>' to perform feature selection, this will create two files namely 'final_data.csv' with optimal features and 'final_selected_features.txt' which contains the selected features along with their value.
5. Run 'python model_train.py <train_test/k-fold>' to train the model, a dump of the trained model is created.
5. Finally run 'python predict.py <apk-name>' to perform the classification of that given apk.

Happy Coding.
